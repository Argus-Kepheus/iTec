NEONATAL HIPOTERMIA AND NEONATAL ANOXIA 
Introduction 
Therapeutic hypothermia is a neuroprotective strategy who reduces mortality, and 
disability of newborns‚Äô with encephalopathy Hypoxic-Ischemic from asphyxia perinatal. The 
therapy should start within the first six hours after birth and consists of reducing the body 
temperature of neonates (average of 33¬∫C - 34¬∫C degrees) for 72 hours [4,6,7]. Hypothermia 
reduces brain metabolism by approximately 5 % for every 1¬∞C decrease in temperature of the 
body, which delayed the onset of cellular anoxic depolarization [8]. 
Objective 
The goal of this study reported two clinical cases describing the effects of neonatal 
hypothermia in babies with perinatal asphyxia and motor development in a follow-up program 
after hospital discharge. 
Methods 
This is a retrospective case report involving two children diagnosed with 
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to neonatal asphyxia and submitted to a hypothermia 
protocol in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Data regarding the prenatal, perinatal, 
and postnatal periods were collected from the children's medical records. Subsequently, an 
interview with the guardian was conducted using a semi-structured maternal history guide, 
including general information about the mother and baby. The children were followed up in 
the high-risk outpatient clinic and evaluated using the Hammersmith Neurological 
Examination (HINE), motor development assessment using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale 
[AIMS], and the Denver II screening test. The instruments were administered according to the 
recommendations in the assessment manuals and were administered by trained evaluators. 
The study was approved by the University's Research Ethics Committee. 
Case description 
Newborn, woman, born by cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestational age, weighing 
3.055g and length of 46,5cm. The patient presented an Apgar score of 5 and 6 in the first and 
fifth minutes, respectively, requiring a cycle of PPV. The infant evolved with respiratory 
distress; thus, 20% oxygen was delivery for 1 (one) hour, followed by 3 (three) hours of 
CPAP. After 4 hours of life the patient presented worsening of respiratory distress and the 
presence of cyanosis in the extremities, being intubated and during intubation she presented 
an episode of hyperextension of the upper limbs, internal rotation of the wrists and seizure. 
Due to the tests which showed perinatal asphyxia, the therapeutic hypothermia protocol was 
started, turning off the crib until the patient reached the ideal temperature 32¬∞ - 35¬∞C, being 
monitored every 20min., and remaining for 74 (seventy-four) hours. The baby was diagnosed 
with late neonatal sepsis in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and required 6 (six) days of 
antibiotics. ‚ÄúTransfontanellary ultrasound‚Äù was performed, indicating a reduction of the sulci 
and diffuse hyperechogenicity. After seven days, a Cranial Magnetic Resonance (CMR) 
demonstrated a sequelae of severe perinatal ‚Äúhypoxic-ischemic event‚Äù. The patient remained 
12 days in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and 10 days in the ward, being 
discharged with a diet by breast and milk formula. In the neurological examination at 
discharge, the patient presented mild hypotonia generalized and primitive reflexes present and 
symmetrical (search reflex, palm and plantar handgrip and complete moro and tonic-cervical 
reflex present). Currently, the child has a chronological age of 3 years and 3 months, and 
evaluations conducted by the physiotherapy team at the pediatric outpatient clinic will 
demonstrate motor development within the normal range for the age 
Conclusion 
The cases presented involved two children diagnosed with encephalopathy 
hypoxic-ischemic due to perinatal asphyxia that received a therapeutic protocol of 
hypothermia for 74 hr with strict monitoring of body temperature. They were followed up at 
the outpatient clinic by the multidisciplinary team and in the assessment of motor 
development, it was observed that both patients had normal motor development. The results 
obtained are favorable for the use of the neonatal hypothermia protocol as a ‚Äúneuroprotective 
intervention‚Äù in babies with perinatal asphyxia minimizing and preventing sequelae in 
children's motor development
