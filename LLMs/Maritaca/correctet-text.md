Therapeutic Hypothermia and Neonatal Anoxia: Case Reports on Neuroprotection and Motor Development

## üìÑ Introduction
Therapeutic hypothermia is a neuroprotective strategy that reduces mortality and disability in newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) resulting from perinatal asphyxia. The therapy should commence within the first six hours after birth and involves reducing the body temperature of neonates to an average of 33‚Äì34¬∞C for 72 hours \cite{Azzopardi2014, Laptook2017, Silveira2015}. Hypothermia decreases brain metabolism by approximately 5% for every 1¬∞C reduction in body temperature, thereby delaying the onset of cellular anoxic depolarization \cite{Silveira2015}.

## üìÑ Objective
The aim of this study is to report two clinical cases describing the effects of neonatal hypothermia on babies with perinatal asphyxia and their subsequent motor development in a follow-up program after hospital discharge.

## üìÑ Methods
This retrospective case report involves two children diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to neonatal asphyxia who underwent a hypothermia protocol in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Data regarding the prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal periods were collected from the children's medical records. Subsequently, an interview with the guardian was conducted using a semi-structured maternal history guide, including general information about the mother and baby. The children were followed up in the high-risk outpatient clinic and evaluated using the Hammersmith Neurological Examination (HINE), motor development assessment with the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS), and the Denver II screening test. The assessments were conducted according to the manuals' recommendations by trained evaluators. The study was approved by the University's Research Ethics Committee.

## üìÑ Case Description
A female newborn, delivered by cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestational age, weighing 3055 g and measuring 46.5 cm, presented an Apgar score of 5 and 6 at the first and fifth minutes, respectively, requiring positive pressure ventilation (PPV). The infant developed respiratory distress and received 20% oxygen for 1 hour, followed by 3 hours of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Four hours after birth, the patient's respiratory distress worsened, with cyanosis in the extremities, leading to intubation. During intubation, she exhibited an episode of hyperextension of the upper limbs, internal rotation of the wrists, and seizure. Given the diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia, the therapeutic hypothermia protocol was initiated by turning off the crib heating until the patient reached an ideal temperature of 32‚Äì35¬∞C, monitored every 20 minutes, and maintained for 74 hours. A transfontanellar ultrasound indicated reduced sulci and diffuse hyperechogenicity. After seven days, a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated sequelae from a severe hypoxic-ischemic event. The patient stayed 12 days in the NICU and 10 days in the ward, being discharged with a diet consisting of breast milk and formula. At discharge, the neurological examination revealed mild generalized hypotonia and symmetrical primitive reflexes (rooting, palmar and plantar grasp, and complete Moro and tonic-cervical reflexes). Currently, the child is 3 years and 3 months old, and assessments by the physiotherapy team at the pediatric outpatient clinic indicate motor development within the normal range for her age.

## üìÑ Conclusion
The cases presented involved two children diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to perinatal asphyxia who received a therapeutic hypothermia protocol for 74 hours with strict monitoring of body temperature. Follow-up assessments by the multidisciplinary team showed that both patients had normal motor development. These results support the use of the neonatal hypothermia protocol as a neuroprotective intervention in babies with perinatal asphyxia, potentially minimizing and preventing sequelae in children's motor development.
