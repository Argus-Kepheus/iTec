# ACADEMIC TEXT REVISION SYSTEM

## Overview

The **Academic Text Revision System** is a prompt-based framework designed to revise and standardize scientific and academic manuscripts written in English. It integrates a structured prompt architecture with LaTeX formatting to produce consistent, professional-quality outputs.

Although optimized for English-language academic writing, the system also supports input texts in other Latin-based languages (e.g., Portuguese, Spanish, Italian). These texts are automatically normalized and refined using large language models (LLMs), and the final outputs are presented in English with full LaTeX integration.

This framework enables a direct **comparative evaluation of 12 distinct LLMs**, all relying on the same standardized input prompt (`input.md`), formatting pipeline, and evaluation metrics.

**IMPORTANT:** For project reviewers, the most relevant files are the corresponding `corrected-text.md` and `input + corrected-text + report.pdf` documents. Please refer to these first for a concise overview of each model’s performance.

## Components

### `Prompt.md`
Contains the engineered prompt responsible for guiding each LLM in the academic revision process. It defines all operational rules, security constraints, reference formatting transformations, and output structure.

### `Prompt + input.md`
- Contains the original academic draft provided by the user coupled/mounted monolitically in `Prompt.md`.
- Serves as the standardized source text shared across all models.

### `LLMs/`
- Includes individual subfolders for each tested language model:
- `ChatGPT`     — OpenAI          — United States  — [https://chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com)
- `Claude`      — Anthropic       — United States  — [https://claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
- `Copilot`     — Microsoft       — United States  — [https://copilot.microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com)
- `DeepSeek`    — DeepSeek AI     — China          — [https://www.deepseek.com/en](https://www.deepseek.com/en)
- `Gemini`      — Google DeepMind — United States  — [https://gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)
- `Grok`        — xAI             — United States  — [https://grok.com](https://grok.com)
- `Le Chat`     — Mistral         — France         — [https://mistral.ai/en](https://mistral.ai/en/products/le-chat)
- `Maritaca`    — Maritaca AI     — Brazil         — [https://www.maritaca.ai](https://www.maritaca.ai)
- `Meta`        — Meta AI         — United States  — [https://meta.ai](https://meta.ai)
- `Perplexity`  — Perplexity AI   — United States  — [https://www.perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai)
- `Qwen`        — Alibaba         — China          — [https://qwen.ai](https://qwen.ai)
- `You`         — You.com         — United States  — [https://you.com](https://you.com)


Each subfolder contains:
- `corrected-text.md` — The revised manuscript generated by the model, including all references formatted in `.bib` structure.  
- `LaTeX output/` — Contains the LaTeX files required for compilation (`main.tex`, `reference.bib`, etc.).  
- `input + corrected-text + report.pdf` — A combined PDF showing the original input, the corrected text, and the processing report. This was compiled using the “Print-Friendly” browser extension (Google Chrome) to preserve layout and visual consistency from the model’s web interface.

### `LaTeX template/`
- Stores the centralized LaTeX formatting files used to compile each output.  
- Includes an example PDF demonstrating consistent formatting and citation style.  
- Ensures visual and typographic uniformity across all model outputs.

## Workflow

1. Place/couple/mount your academic raw/draft in `Prompt.md` in the brackets "[Insert complete text including title]"; this will generate your `Prompt + input.md` version.
2. Run the unified **Academic Text Revision Prompt** from your `Prompt + input.md` through each target GUI/API LLM model.  
3. Retrieve and save the generated revised text into the corresponding LLM folder.  
4. Compile each model’s output using the LaTeX template to maintain consistent formatting.  
5. Review the generated PDF to evaluate linguistic accuracy, formatting quality, and reference consistency.

## Notes

- This project is intended strictly for **academic and research purposes**.  
- All outputs are generated using publicly accessible large language models and open-source templates.  
- The system does **not alter factual information, conclusions, or data** — it focuses exclusively on linguistic, grammatical, and stylistic refinement according to English academic standards.  
- The integrated prompt includes **anti-hallucination** and **security safeguards** to preserve the integrity of the original text and prevent unauthorized instruction injection.
